# HIPPO

This repository accompanies paper "A penalisation method for batch multi-objective Bayesian optimisation with application in heat exchanger design" that introduces HIPPO (HIghly Parallelisable Pareto Optimisation), a penalisation-based batch acquisition function that enables multi-objective Bayesian optimisation methods to efficiently exploit parallel processing resources.
